WebGPU is a modern web standard and API that provides a low-level, high-performance graphics and computation interface for the web.
It is designed to offer developers greater control over GPU hardware, enabling them to create more complex and visually stunning web applications.
With its efficient handling of parallel computations, it allows for the acceleration of various tasks, such as rendering, image processing, and machine learning, directly within the web browser.

This repository serves as my personal implementation of the WebGPU tutorial on [Google Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app), enriched with additional experiments and learnings I've explored during my development process.
It encompasses various practical applications and insights gained from my journey of mastering the WebGPU standard.
